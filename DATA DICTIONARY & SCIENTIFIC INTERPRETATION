📘 DATA DICTIONARY & SCIENTIFIC INTERPRETATION
Multimodal Longitudinal Mental-Health Dataset (Synthetic)

This dataset simulates a six-timepoint longitudinal mental-health study commonly seen in computational psychiatry, digital phenotyping, and clinical outcomes research.
It contains three coordinated data modalities:

Clinical outcome ratings

Passive sensor behavior data

EMA-style natural language clinical notes

These modalities mirror real-world psychiatric research workflows used within
UChicago BSD Psychiatry, Lyons Lab Precision Analytics, and digital phenotyping studies.

1️⃣ clinical_longitudinal_data.csv

This is the primary clinical dataset, containing demographic information, treatment assignment, and outcome severity over time.

Column	Type	Description
participant_id	integer	Unique identifier for each participant (1–120). Primary key matching all modalities.
timepoint	integer	Longitudinal assessment index (1–6). Represents sequential visits (weekly, biweekly, or monthly).
treatment_group	integer (0/1)	Experimental condition: 0 = control, 1 = high-intensity therapy. Treatment group drives differences in improvement trajectory.
symptom_score	float	Synthetic continuous psychiatric severity score. Baseline ≈ N(22, 6). Decreases over time, with treatment × time interaction and random noise.
age	float	Participant age (N(35, 10)). Included as demographic covariate.
gender	categorical	Gender identity: Male, Female, Other. Encoded via dummy coding: C(gender) in mixed models.
✔ Summary

This dataset provides the core variables for longitudinal mixed-effects modeling, treatment-effect estimation, and demographic adjustment.

2️⃣ sensor_longitudinal_data.csv

Simulated passive “digital phenotyping” signals collected via smartphone or wearable devices.

Column	Type	Description
participant_id	integer	Matches clinical data.
timepoint	integer	Matches clinical timepoints.
avg_steps	float	Average daily step count. Lower steps correspond to higher symptom burden. Bound at ≥ 500.
sleep_hours	float	Estimated nightly sleep duration (3.5–10 hrs). Symptom severity reduces sleep stability.
phone_usage_minutes	float	Estimated daily smartphone use (30–600 minutes). Higher symptoms → more phone time.
✔ Interpretation of Sensor Variables

avg_steps → psychomotor activity
Reduced movement is a known marker of depression/anxiety.

sleep_hours → circadian stability
Sleep disruption correlates strongly with mood disorders.

phone_usage_minutes → avoidance/rumination
Digital phenotyping studies show increased screen time during distress.

3️⃣ text_notes_longitudinal_data.csv

EMA-style, qualitative clinical notes describing each participant’s subjective mood and engagement.

Column	Type	Description
participant_id	integer	Matches clinical + sensor data.
timepoint	integer	Longitudinal visit index.
note_text	string	Natural-language summary generated based on symptom severity + treatment condition. Reflects mood, functioning, and therapy engagement.
✔ Example Note

“At visit 3, the participant reports struggling with mood but noticing some better days, while engaging regularly with therapy exercises. Sleep and energy fluctuate.”

✔ Text Usage

📊 Multimodal Relationships Designed Into the Dataset

This dataset encodes scientifically grounded relationships among modalities.

🔷 Clinical → Sensor Patterns

Higher psychiatric symptom severity leads to:

Symptom Effect	Sensor Behavior
↑ symptoms	↓ steps (psychomotor slowing, anhedonia)
↑ symptoms	↓ sleep stability (rumination, circadian disruption)
↑ symptoms	↑ phone use (avoidance, late-night scrolling, stress)

These are validated in digital phenotyping research.

🔷 Clinical → Text Patterns

Symptom-based mapping:

Symptom Score	Text Description
> 22	“very overwhelmed and anxious”
18–22	“struggling with mood”
14–18	“somewhat better and hopeful”
< 14	“much more stable and engaged”

Treatment-based phrasing:

Treatment group (1): “engaging regularly with therapy and exercises”

Control group (0): “attending check-ins but not in high-intensity therapy”

🧠 Scientific Rationale: Why Symptoms Affect Steps, Sleep, Phone Use

The dataset encodes known behavioral associations:

1. Symptoms → ↓ Steps

Depression/anxiety cause:

Low energy

Social withdrawal

Psychomotor slowing

Reduced physical activity

Steps are one of the strongest digital biomarkers of worsening mood.

2. Symptoms → ↓ Sleep Stability

Symptoms disrupt sleep through:

Hyperarousal

Rumination

Disturbed circadian rhythms

Insomnia

Signs in the data:

Lower sleep hours

Higher variability

More nighttime awakenings

3. Symptoms → ↑ Phone Use

Distress increases screen usage due to:

Avoidance

Rumination

Social media coping

Late-night use during insomnia

This correlation is widely documented in digital phenotyping literature.
