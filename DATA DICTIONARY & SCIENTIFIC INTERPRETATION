📘 DATA DICTIONARY & SCIENTIFIC INTERPRETATION
Multimodal Longitudinal Mental-Health Dataset (Synthetic)

This dataset simulates a six-timepoint longitudinal mental-health study commonly seen in computational psychiatry, digital phenotyping, and clinical outcomes research.
It contains three coordinated data modalities:

Clinical outcome ratings

Passive sensor behavior data

EMA-style natural language clinical notes

This dataset is ideal for:

1. Longitudinal mixed-effects modeling

2. Multimodal fusion

3. Computational psychiatry modeling

4. NLP + LLM-assisted clinical analysis

5. Precision outcome forecasting

These modalities mirror real-world psychiatric research workflows used within
UChicago BSD Psychiatry, Lyons Lab Precision Analytics, and digital phenotyping studies.

This dataset provides the core variables for longitudinal mixed-effects modeling, treatment-effect estimation, and demographic adjustment.

2️⃣ sensor_longitudinal_data.csv

Simulated passive “digital phenotyping” signals collected via smartphone or wearable devices.

| Column                  | Type    | Description                                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **participant_id**      | integer | Matches clinical data.                                                       |
| **timepoint**           | integer | Matches clinical timepoints.                                                 |
| **avg_steps**           | float   | Mean daily steps. Lower values correspond to higher symptom burden (≥ 500).  |
| **sleep_hours**         | float   | Nightly sleep duration (3.5–10 hrs). Higher symptoms → more irregular sleep. |
| **phone_usage_minutes** | float   | Daily smartphone usage (30–600 min). Higher symptoms → increased usage.      |

✔ Interpretation of Sensor Variables

avg_steps → psychomotor activity
Reduced movement is a known marker of depression/anxiety.

sleep_hours → circadian stability
Sleep disruption correlates strongly with mood disorders.

phone_usage_minutes → avoidance/rumination
Digital phenotyping studies show increased screen time during distress.

3️⃣ text_notes_longitudinal_data.csv

EMA-style, qualitative clinical notes describing each participant’s subjective mood and engagement.

| Column             | Type    | Description                                                                |

📊 Multimodal Relationships Designed Into the Dataset

This dataset encodes scientifically grounded relationships among modalities.

🔷 Clinical → Sensor Patterns

Higher psychiatric symptom severity leads to:

| Symptom Change | Sensor Behavior                                                         |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ↑ symptoms     | **↓ avg_steps** (psychomotor slowing, low energy)                       |
| ↑ symptoms     | **↓ sleep_hours** (insomnia, rumination)                                |
| ↑ symptoms     | **↑ phone_usage_minutes** (avoidance, doom-scrolling, late-night usage) |


These are validated in digital phenotyping research.

🔷 Clinical → Text Patterns

Symptom-based mapping:

| Symptom Score | Mood Description                   |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| > 22          | “very overwhelmed and anxious”     |
| 18–22         | “struggling with mood”             |
| 14–18         | “somewhat better and more hopeful” |
| < 14          | “much more stable and engaged”     |


Treatment-based phrasing:

Treatment group (1): “engaging regularly with therapy and exercises”

Control group (0): “attending check-ins but not in high-intensity therapy”

🧠 Scientific Rationale: Why Symptoms Affect Steps, Sleep, Phone Use

The dataset encodes known behavioral associations:

1. Symptoms → ↓ Steps

eople with higher symptoms demonstrate:

Reduced energy

Psychomotor slowing

Lower motivation

Social withdrawal

Less physical activity

Step count is a validated digital biomarker for depression severity.

2. Symptoms → ↓ Sleep Stability

Higher symptoms cause:

  -Hyperarousal

  -Rumination

  -Fragmented sleep

  -Irregular circadian rhythms

Participants show:

  -Lower average sleep

  -Higher variability

  -More awakenings

3. Symptoms → ↑ Phone Use

Distress increases screen usage due to:

People experiencing distress often compensate via:

  -Avoidant scrolling

  -Social media use

  -Late-night phone use

  -Reinforcement-seek behavior

Digital phenotyping studies consistently show:

↑ depression → ↑ screen time

↑ anxiety → ↑ compulsive checking

↓ sleep → ↑ nighttime phone use

This correlation is widely documented in digital phenotyping literature.
